# Acknowledgements

A big thank you to my wife Hilary Nihlen, whos support and companionship has made Scintillator possible.

I'd also like to thank Nathan Ho for his friendship and many conversations about Scintillator and SuperCollider
development.

# Vulkan Programming

  * [The Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) - much of the original Vulkan setup code was typed in following
  this tutorial.
  * [Sascha Willems](https://www.saschawillems.de/) maintains numerous worked examples of various applications of Vulkan
  from which I have cribbed from heavily. Also the [Vulkan Hardware Database](https://vulkan.gpuinfo.org/) is a great
  source of information about the diversity of hardware out there supporting Vulkan.
