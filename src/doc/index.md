Scintillator scinsynth C++ Documentation {#index}
========================================

The Scintillator Quark contains documentation for both the SuperCollider sclang objects, which uses the SuperCollider
built-in help system, and this Doxygen-generated documentation for the C++ scinsynth code. For documentation issues that
concern both sclang and scinsynth matters the decision is to leverage the SuperCollider built-in help, following the
logic that similar discussions about scsynth, the SuperCollider audio synthesis engine, are found in the SuperCollider
help system as well. As a result this domain is reserved largely for scinsynth topics.

Besides the API documentation accessible from the "Classes" menu tab above there are these additional documents included
here:

*  [Compiling scinsynth From Source](@ref BuildingScinsynth)
*  [References and Acknowledgements](@ref ReferencesAndAcknowledgements)
